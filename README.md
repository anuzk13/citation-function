# Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for the paper Citation Classification for Behavioral Analysis of a Scientific Field. David Jurgens, Srijan Kumar, Raine Hoover, Dan McFarland, Dan Jurafsky. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL). 2018

## Requirements

This project uses Python 2 and requires the following packages

```
pycorenlp==0.2.0
fuzzywuzzy
joblib
sklearn
ftfy==4.4.3
```

The program was developed using Stanford CoreNLP 3.6.0 .  Later versions may work but have not been tested.

If you're running the preprocessing steps from scratch, you'll need to have the Stanford CoreNLP server running on port 8999.  See [https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/corenlp-server.html] for instructions.
